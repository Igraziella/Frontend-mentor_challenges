## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Css could be a bit tricky when one is not familiar with element attributes.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  box-sizing: content-box;
}

### Continued development

I'm still trying to get familiar with attributes of elements in html & css. I realised that some elements do not take certain attributes. for example, the img element cannot have a colour attribute, but can take a width and height attribute. It's going to take some getting used to but i'll keep practicing.

### Useful resources

- https://blog.hubspot.com/website - This is an amazing article which helped me understand positioning and the flex property. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
